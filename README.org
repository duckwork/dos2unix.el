The dos2unix command-line program is amazing, but it doesn't run in Emacs
directly, which means that on, say, Windows, it's a real pain to get setup
right.  This package emulates that functionality within Emacs so that you can
use it wherever you can use Emacs.

* Commands

- ~dos2unix-region~ :: Replace =\r\n= with =\n= in a region.
- ~dos2unix-buffer~ :: Replace =\r\n= with =\n= in a buffer.
- ~dos2unix-dwim~ :: Replace =\r\n= with =\n= in the active region or current buffer,
  whichever makes more sense.  This is the one you probably want to use most of
  the time.

* License

Everyone is permitted to do whatever with this software, without limitation.
This software comes without any warranty whatsoever, but with two pieces of
advice:

- Be kind to yourself.
- Make good choices.

* Still to do

It might be a good idea to include unix2dos commands as well, but IÂ never want
to do that personally.

Of course, contributions and issue requests are welcome!
